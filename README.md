## UCSRMediaPlayer
(Unnecessarily Complex Simple Remote Media Player)

Unnecessarily Complex Simple Remote Media Player is (or will be) a collection of microservices that create a media player controllable over web interface and/or application made for the purpose. Or that's the plan anyway. Code will be updated infrequently and all there is for the moment is some utilities and code samples that don't do much.
